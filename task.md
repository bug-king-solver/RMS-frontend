# Challenge Brief

## Project Description

Build a Resource Management System (RMS): The system allow users to manage a set of resources of your choosing(e.b., books, products, contracts, etc.).

## Requirements

### Backend

- Use NestJS for the API structure.
- Implement Prisma with Postgres for database handling.
- Leverage Apollo Graphql for queries and mutations.

### Frontend

- Use React 18 for building the user interface.
- Syle the application using Tailwind CSS.

Where applicable, TypeScript should be used, not JavaScript.

### Features

1. Create: Users should be able to add new resources, including necessary details.
2. Read: Users should be able to view a list of resources and detailed information for each one.
3. Update: Users should be able to modify existing resource details.
4. Delete: Users should be able to remove resources from the system.

### Optional Extras

Consider these aspects if you'd like to go beyond the basic requirements:

- Implementing unit tests.
- Adding continuous integration(CI)funcionality.
- Hosting the application

### Evaluation Criteria

We'll be looking at the following:

- Functionality: Does the application perform all the CRUD operations effectively?
- Code Quality: Is the code clean and well-organized?
- Initiative: Any extra features or effors showing a deeper understanding or interest in the role.

### Submission

Please provide the source code, any relevant documentation, and, if applicable, a link to the hosted application.
Remember, the primary goal is exercise the technology stack and demonstrate your ability to build a simple yet effective soultin.
We're interested in seeing how you work with our chosen tools and your ability to apply them creatively.

Good luch and happy coding
